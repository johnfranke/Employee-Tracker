# Employee Tracker

This is a command-line application that allows the user to add departments, roles, and employees. The user can also view departments, roles, and employees. If the user chooses, they can also update employee roles.

It was created by using Node, Inquirer, and MySQL. This application would be great for a business owner to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company so they can organize and plan their business.
